# Snek

A dependency-less browser game of Snake.

## Why am I doing this?

I want to feel more comfortable with vanilla JS, learn the Gamepad API, and do some CSS wizardry.

## Hey, you _do_ have dependencies!

I want my code to look nice and be able to test my code, so I'm allowing a linter and test runner.
